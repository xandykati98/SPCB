# Standard Post-Collapse Backup (SPCB)

**A Comprehensive Resource for Post-Collapse Tech Preparedness**

## Overview

Welcome to the Standard Post-Collapse Backup (SPCB)—a project focused on aggregating and organizing existing technical knowledge to help you maintain functional, reliable, and self-sufficient computing systems in a scenario where modern infrastructure fails.

While many preppers focus on simple solutions like Kiwix, map downloads, or basic e-book libraries, SPCB takes a more holistic approach. We aim to gather a wide array of critical intel—guides, manuals, and tutorials covering everything from solar-powered computing setups and offline LAN configurations to mesh networks and robust data storage strategies.

**The Goal:** Ensure that, when the grid goes dark and the traditional internet disappears, you have the tools, knowledge, and digital resources needed to keep your technology running. No technical background? No problem. We prioritize accessibility and clarity, ensuring anyone can follow along and implement these solutions.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Collection:** Instead of creating new content, SPCB curates and organizes existing, reliable information. This broad approach ensures that nothing is overlooked when it comes to technical prepping.
  
- **Scalable Storage Options:** We consider all storage capacities—from 2GB flash drives and 16GB SD cards to 1TB or 4TB external drives, and even unlimited storage solutions. SPCB will guide you in tailoring your data hoard to what you can realistically maintain.
  
- **Self-Sufficient Compute Grids:** Learn how to build and maintain solar-powered systems, offline LANs, and mesh networks that remain operational in a disconnected world.
  
- **User-Friendly Guidance:** All instructions are formatted to be accessible for non-technical users. Our goal is to empower everyone to keep their tech functional and secure.
  
- **Community Collaboration:** By joining you can share ideas, discover new resources, and refine best practices. We’re dedicated to making SPCB a living project shaped by the insights and experiences of preppers worldwide.
